# Welcome to Farm Assistant

Hi there, Farmer! ðŸ‘‹ I am a chatbot that helps you monitor the health level of your maize plants. I do this by analyzing images of your crops, which you upload.

## Getting started
Here is how to make use of me: 

- **Upload Image:** Take a photo of the plant you suspect is infeceted, then upload it.
- **Analysis:** I will then analyze the image to find out what disease it suffers from, then tell you more about that diasease
- **Chat:** You can then ask me more about the diasease, including how to deal with it(pesticides, fungicides) as well as where to find aggrovets.
